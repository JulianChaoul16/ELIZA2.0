## ELIZA – Rule-Based Psychotherapist Chatbot (Python)
# Description

This project is a simplified, rule-based implementation of ELIZA, an early natural-language processing program that simulates a psychotherapist through pattern matching and scripted responses.

The program runs entirely in the command line and generates responses using deterministic string-processing techniques rather than machine learning or statistical models.
